Wrapper for use of the 'emcee' Python module with dStar

Currently in heavy development.

See docs/api.txt for info on how to interact with the package.

Setting up dStar first:
1) This module should be used (either by script or terminal tomfoolery) from a 
DSTAR WORKING DIRECTORY. That means there needs to be a compiled and ready run_dStar 
IN the current working directory (plus anything dStar might whine about, like LOGS dir).
2) dStar must be configured to spit out a chi^2 goodness of fit, JUST the number,
as the very last line to stdout. See the "fit_lightcurve" example that comes with dStar
for ideas on how to calculate the chi^2 in run.f using clever Mdot_epochs and 
Teff_monitor.
3) There MUST be an 'inlist_preamble' in the working directory!!!
This basically just means taking the desired inlist for the dStar run of choice,
chop off the "bottom" (the trailing slash, and any controls one might not want hanging
around), and call it 'inlist_preamble'. This file will be copied to actual 'inlist' 
before each dStar run and then the MCMC params + values will be appended, along with
the trailing slash/returns to close the file.
