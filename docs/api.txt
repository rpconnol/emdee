API for class Emdee:

__init__(mode=None, loc=None)
  When creating an Emdee class, 'mode' must be chosen.
  If mode == 'load', then supply a loc and a previous emdee run will be loaded.
  If mode == 'new',  then a new save directory is created.
	If loc == None, then the directory will be named generically [date/time].
	If loc is specified, then the data will be saved here.
	  Note: this directory must be empty! (will throw exception)
  example: MuhClass = emdee.Emdee(mode='load',loc='saved_LOGS/mass_100walkers')


Variables:
params -- names of dStar parameters to include in the MCMC analysis
lbounds -- lower bounds on the above parameters
ubounds -- upper bounds on the above parameters
gaussinit -- dictionary of {param: [mean,sigma]} for optional Gaussian
             initialization of parameters (see AddParam or _InitWalkers)
nwalkers -- number of walkers in the MCMC, default = 100
dstar_dir -- location of dStar on the machine. Defaults to "$DSTAR_DIR", if 
             this environment variable is set then you shouldn't need to mess 
             with this.
data_dir -- Location of saved data
_lastlogged -- the last time step written to the logs / file output. For 
               loaded runs, this will be determined from the final line of 
               the loaded histories.
_current_pos -- current "positions" of the walkers. If run is new, this is
                created (uniform random distribution within provided bounds) when
                GoMCMC is called for the first time.
_current_lnprob -- the "current" log-probabilities of each walker. If run is new,
				   this is None. If run is in progress or loaded, this helps save
				   time so an extra dStar run isnt needed to calculate the 
				   lnprob at _current_pos
_localChain -- the saved and persistent version of _emceeSampler.chain. This is what
			   results are plotted from, and this is populated by the saved data files
			   when emdee is initialized with mode = 'load'.
_emceeSampler -- the emcee.EnsembleSampler class



"Public" functions (user interface):

AddParam(p,b,gaussian_init)
	Adds a dStar parameter p to the MCMC, with bounds b=[lower,upper].
	If a parameter is already in the list, you'll get yelled at.
	If you want to guess initial positions from a normal distribution, provide
	gaussian_init=[mean,sigma]. Otherwise inital walker positions uniformly
	random within bounds.
	example:  Emdee.AddParam("core_mass",[1.4,2.0],gaussian_init=[1.6,0.1])
	If one doesn't provide bounds, a default pair will be chosen 
	(see _DefaultBounds).
	Can only be performed if the run is fresh (_lastlogged == 0)!

ChangeBounds(p,b,gaussian_init)
	Changes the bounds b on a parameter p that's already in the MCMC.
	gaussian_init same as in AddParam.
	If the parameter isn't in the list yet, you'll get yelled at.
	example:  Emdee.ChangeBounds("core_mass",[1.6,2.1])
	Must provide bounds manually for this! If you desperately want defaults try:
	[class].ChangeBounds("core_mass",[class]._DefaultBounds("core_mass"))
	Can only be performed if the run is fresh (_lastlogged == 0)!

PrintParams(printbounds=True)
	Print the current dStar parameters and bounds.
	printbounds=False for just a list of the parameter names

ChangeWalkers(n)
	Changes the number of walkers.
	Can only be performed if the run is fresh (_lastlogged == 0)!

ChangeDStarDir(newdir)
	Changes the dStar base directory. The default is $DSTAR_DIR; it's 
    probably better to set the DSTAR_DIR environment variable externally 
    and just leave this as is.

GoMCMC(nsteps,output=True)
	** Big one **
	Run nsteps of MCMC with the current params and their bounds.
	Make sure the dStar side of things is already set (see "Setting up dStar" 
    above). After all nsteps complete (careful, could be time consuming!), 
    if output=True, the emcee chains will be saved to files.
	if output=False, the results are still saved in the emcee class and can
	be plotted or manipulated, but once the class/script is closed they gone.

PlotChains(save=False,name="chain.png")
	Plot the values of each parameter as a time series for all walkers.
	Useful for checking out burn in times. If save == False the plot is just
	shown on-screen; if save == True the plot is saved to loc (include extension).

PlotCorner(save=False,name="corner.png",burnin=0,lastpt=False)
	Make a corner plot of the MCMC results. If save == False the plot is just
	shown on-screen; if save == True the plot is saved to loc (include extension).
	burnin -- can be set to chop off the first burnin steps.
	lastpt -- will only plot the final position of each walker, rather than 
              all data after burnin (burnin is ignored if lastpt==True).

PrintPercentiles(lowmidhigh=[16,50,84],burnin=0,lastpt=False,print_acor=False,_log=False)
	Print the "values + error bars" of each parameter. By default, "Mean" 
    value is 50th percentile, "upper error" is 84th percentile, "lower error" 
    is 16th percentile.
	These can be set manually with lowmidhigh.
	burnin and lastpt work same as in PlotCorner.
	print_acor will include the estimated autocorrelation time for each parameter.
	_log is for internal use; returns the output as a string, instead of just printing it.





"Private" functions:

_InitWalkers()
	Initialize the walkers with positions for each param taken from 
    respective bounds. If self.gaussinit[param] is defined (see AddParam or 
	ChangeBounds), the initial positions for param are pulled from a normal
	distribution. If not, just chosen uniformly random within bounds.

_InitSampler()
	Initializes self.emceeSampler as an emcee.EnsembleSampler with self.nwalkers,
	ndim=len(self.params), and self._LnProb as the log-probability function.

emdeeDefaults.Bounds(p)
	Returns a default set of bounds for some common dStar parameters.
	Try emdeeDefaults.Bounds() to print a list of parameters and defaults.
	If the given parameter is not in the list of defaults, returns [0,0].
	NOTE: Highly recommended to set bounds manually for your specific problem,
		  either to help speed up convergence with motivated constraints,
		  or if you find your MCMC is piling up at one of the default bounds!

emdeeDefaults.Format(p)
	Returns a "typical" format (string) for printing values of common dStar
	parameters. Mostly used for interfacing with the user; values generated
	by the sampler and printed to the inlist/data files should be done with
	much higher precision (likely just let Python decide)
	
_MakeInlist(theta)
	Copies inlist_preamble to inlist and appends the current params & values (theta).

_RunDStar()
	Calls a dStar run, pipes the stdout, and returns the chi^2 (it better 
    be the very last line dStar prints to the terminal!).
	
_LnLike(theta)
	log-likelihood function where most of the work is done, following in the 
    example of the emcee documentation. New walker positions (theta) are fed 
    in, inlist is made, dStar is run, and finally chi^2 / 2.0 is returned.
	
_LnPrior(theta)
	Returns -infinity if any of the chosen positions are outside of their 
    bounds. Otherwise returns a constant (for now: 0.0).

_LnProb(theta)
	Full log-probability function, the sum of LnLike and LnPrior.
	Checks LnPrior first and doesn't actually call LnLike (running dStar) 
    if LnPrior is -infinity.

_LogStart()
	Start a new log if one does not already exist. Log is going to contain 
    info likedate/time of creation, number of walkers, dStar parameters + bounds, etc.
    Only use after parameters are finalized!

_LogUpdate()
	Writes update to log file after GoMCMC. Contains start/end/run time info 
    of that chunk of MCMC, and perhaps some useful info (percentiles, 
    autocorr times, etc).

_Output()
	Writes MCMC data to files after GoMCMC. Currently not functional, deferred in
	preference of _OutputOneLine for now.

_OutputOneLine(pos)
	Writes single (previous) MCMC step (pos) to files. Safer for the time being
	in the event of crashes or issues, job timeout on remote servers, etc.

_OutputCurrentLnprob(lnp,loc='last_lnprob.txt')
	Writes lnp to a file, the most recent lnprobs, which is loaded if this run ever
	needs to be resumed (feeding the sampler the "current" lnprob means it doesn't
	have to recalculate for the initial positions; saves an iteration).

_UpdateLocalChain()
	Stashes the results in sampler.chain to the class's own _localChain. This structure
	works better for loading and plotting old data / resuming runs (emcee doesn't init
	a sampler with user-provided chain data).

_ReadLog()
	Reads in dStar params and bounds from a LOG.txt file to a mode=="load" initialization.

_LoadLocalChain()
	Loads previous results into _localChain in a mode=="load" initialization.

_SetCurrentConditions()
	Sets _current_pos and _current_lnprob from loaded results in mode=="load" init.
