This is an example to illustrate the "typical" use and common functions of an emdee
science run. 

1_new_run.py outlines creating a new emdee class and executing from scratch.
2_load_run.py outlines the functionality for loading old results and continuing from
  where the previous run left off.  
3_results_and_plots.py illustrates the plotting and 
  other output functionality for actually crunching results.
